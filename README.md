# Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) - Excel Template

This repository contains an [Excel template](https://github.com/datacontract/open-data-contract-standard-excel-template/raw/refs/heads/main/odcs-template.xlsx) for authoring data contracts using the **Open Data Contract Standard V3**. 
It provides a user-friendly interface to define and share data contracts with stakeholders, especially those less familiar with YAML.
You can convert the Excel into YAML through the [Data Contract CLI](#data-contract-cli) or upload it directly to [Data Mesh Manager](#data-mesh-manager).

## üßæ What is a Data Contract?

A **data contract**, such as [ODCS](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard/latest/), defines the structure, format, semantics, quality, and terms of use for data exchanged between a producer and one or more consumers.

While data contracts are typically written in YAML, this Excel template enables easier collaboration, review, and iteration‚Äîespecially across business and technical teams.


## üìÑ Template Overview

The Excel file includes the following sheets:

### 1. `Instructions`
Provides a quick guide on how to fill out the template.

### 2. `Fundamentals`
Captures general metadata for the data contract, including ID, Name, Version, Domain and Description.

### 3. `Schema <table_name>`
Defines the data model with all properties.

Copy this sheet for every table in your data contract.

### 4. `Support`

Support and communication channels help consumers find help regarding their use of the data contract.

### 5. `Team`

This section lists team members and the history of their relation with this data contract. In v2.x, this section was called stakeholders.

### 6. `Roles`

This section lists team members and the history of their relation with this data contract.

### 7. `SLA`

This section describes the service-level agreements (SLA).

### 8. `Servers`

The servers element describes where the data protected by this data contract is physically located. 

### 9. `Pricing`

This section covers pricing when you bill your customer for using this data product.

### 10. `Custom Properties`

Use this optional sheet to define additional metadata or annotations.


## üöÄ Integrations

### Data Contract CLI
Use the open-source [Data Contract CLI](https://github.com/datacontract/datacontract-cli) to convert the Excel template to or from YAML.

```
datacontract import --format excel --source odcs.xlsx
```

### Data Mesh Manager

Upload the Excel directly in [Data Mesh Manager](https://datamesh-manager.com) using the ‚ÄúImport Excel‚Äù feature, and open existing ODCS data contracts in Excel using the "Open in Excel" feature.
